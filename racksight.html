                <h3>About RackSight</h3>
                <p>RackSight is a mobile app that offers personalized recommendations, featuring a scanning tool that provides detailed information about gym equipment and videos for visual guidance. Additionally, its social feed creates a supportive gym community where users can share content, ask questions, and engage in workouts together.</p>

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>There is a lack of accessible, organized content for beginners to effectively learn and implement proper workout techniques. Fitness apps often fall short of providing the specific features needed, making it difficult to track progress and understand machine instructions, leaving users frustrated and uncertain.</p>

                <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p>To address this, I've developed RackSight—a mobile app that provides personalized guidance, detailed machine scanning, and a supportive social community to help users seamlessly navigate their fitness journeys.</p>

                    <p>I conducted brief interviews with 2-3 individuals who showcased their gym styles in person, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they faced as both beginners and intermediate gym-goers. </p><br>

                    <p>In my analysis, I found some common key themes and insights, such as…</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility and Affordability:</strong> The cost of fitness apps and subscriptions poses a financial barrier, limiting access to resources for all users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personalized Approaches:</strong> Without guidance, users struggle to understand what works best for their fitness goals, contributing to inconsistency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Instructional Support:</strong> Users find machine instructions unhelpful, and some machines lack instructions altogether, discouraging exploration and motivation..</li>
                        <li><strong>Tracker:</strong> There is a lack of consistency in tracking everyday activities when working out, leading to stagnation and random workouts.</li>
