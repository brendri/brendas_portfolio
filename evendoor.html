                <h3>About Evendoor</h3>
                <p>Evendoor is an app designed to connect event organizers with small business owners, offering a centralized hub that simplifies the process of discovering opportunities. It acts as a seamless connection point for networks that are typically decentralized and require significant effort to find.</p>

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>There is an information gap between small business owners and event organizers, making it challenging to connect. The complex, time-consuming search process can be overwhelming and hinder collaboration.</p>

                <h3>Our Solution</h3>
                <p>To address this, we created Evendoor—an app that empowers small business owners to expand as vendors while helping event organizers easily host successful, well-organized events.</p>

                    <p>I conducted interviews with 2-3 diverse small business owners via Zoom, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of their unique challenges, operational methods, and the tools they use to manage and grow their businesses.</p><br>

                    <p>In my analysis, I found some common key themes and insights, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Businesses rely on both digital and in-person connections, emphasizing the need for tools that support flexible engagement.</li>

                        <li><strong>Workflow Strategies:</strong> Effective tools like scheduling, inventory management, and order tracking are essential to support varied business operations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Design:</strong> A user-friendly platform should integrate features like digitizing workflows, communication tools, and flexible scheduling to enhance efficiency and community engagement.</li>
